# MIDAS-IIITD-SI-TASK
This repository intends to solve the various problem statements attributed to the Summer Internship Task at MIDAS@IIITD.

## For the Python Problem
* Please evaluate the code at **main.ipynb** and run the script **main.py** with the required libraries installed to obtain the desired results. 
* The tweets' data is stored at *tweet.json* and *midasIIITD_tweets.csv* files.
* The script is written in Python 3.
* I have removed the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key and access_secret for privacy concerns. Removing this, however can result in ``[{'code': 215, 'message': 'Bad Authentication data.'}]`` error. This can be rectified by providing the required consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key and access_secret by the user running the script.

## For the NLP Problem
* Please evaluate the code at **main.ipynb** and run the script **main.py** with the required libraries installed to obtain the desired results. 
* The result of the script run for *SubtaskA_EvaluationData.csv* is stored at *Anshuman_Pati.csv* file.
* The script is written in Python 2.
